This is an example of what abstraction is using c#. I used the Infinity Gauntlet from Avengers Infinity Wars
as an example of how abstraction is used. I have an abstract class called InfinityGauntlet. Meaning that I cannot create objects
with this class. So I created other classes that inherits from the InfinityGauntlet class. 
I have a protected access modifier so that I cannot change the value of stones inside of the InfinityGauntlet class.
